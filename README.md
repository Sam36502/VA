My Vertiefungsarbeit (In-depth work) on the topic of language complexity and
scope.

## Topic
I intend to create a series of small conlangs to test the limits of comprehension.
I'll translate a short story into the languages and teach them to volunteers
and document how it goes.
If I have time left over, I'll also design a custom writing system with a font for it.
