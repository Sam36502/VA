\chapter{Introduction}
--Valang-- is a constructed language, or conlang, which was created in 2021 for a school
assignment as an experiment. The goal was to create a language which was as small and as
easy to learn as possible. It began as a series of small languages, each being smaller
than the last. I was looking for the point where a language becomes impractically small
and no longer useful in day-to-day life. --Valang-- is the final result of this.
