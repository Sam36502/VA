\section{Problem Description}
In the course of this Advanced Paper, I intend to increase my knowledge on the scope of
language in relation to its complexity. I also intend to research language creation and
will create at least one language of my own to experiment with its scale and applicability.
The main problem I see is that I have never put my theoretical knowledge to the test in
the arena of language creation. I also lack the knowledge on microscopic languages and
wish to further my understanding in this field.

\section{Current State of Research}

\section{Time Plan}
I propose to divide the allotted 8 weeks as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Week 1:}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Read selected UG literature
        \item Provide volunteers with comprehensible input
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Week 2:}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Write first draft of UG Summary with sources
        \item Provide volunteers with comprehensible input
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Week 3:}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Second, Third, etc. drafts of UG Summary with suggested changes
        \item Provide volunteers with comprehensible input
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Week 4:}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Finalise UG Summary
        \item Interview volunteers and transcribe/translate interview
        \item Compile results in final document
        \end{itemize}
